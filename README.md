## Welcome

#### If for some reason you're interested in learning about me, then you've come to the right place!
#### I'm very new to Github, and quite new to the world of programming in general, but I haven't been scared off yet, so hopefully that's a good sign.
#### I first got into coding with the intention of making mods for some of my favorite video games, most specifically Terraria.
